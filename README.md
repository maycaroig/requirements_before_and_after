requirements_before_and_after
=============================

Samples of how my communication skills  and documentation style effectively allows a development team to create in a short turnaround a report that involves complex constraints.

All names and dates modified. Real working document.

A developement team gathered a requirements document from a client that requested a complex report in a short turnaround.

Not all needed data was explicit and required understanding of the workings of a specific clinical experiment.

A few hours from deadline, team realized they could not produce the requested report.

I was called to see if I could help in any way. Here is what I immediately saw:

1) Client knew what they needed but had a hard time conveying those needs.
2) Development team accepted information from client as given, failing to gather complete info.
3) Development team did not know which questions to ask nor how to help client express their needs.
4) Developement team did not have a good understanding of the constraints of the clinical experiment.
5) Client had a good understanding but needed some assistance to remember correct constraints and details.
6) Development team had excellent programming skills to create product but was not able to go past this point.
7) Development team had access to all needed data -- but did not know what data to use or how to use it.

I requested to speak with client. Conversation went for a few minutes during which I asked them a few questions.

I was very familiar with all clinical experiments handled at that center.

-- I read all available trial documentation as soon as it is published.

After that short conversation I was able to explain to developemnt team what client needed and logic involved.

I created the 'after' document in about one hour.

This document exhaustively covered all required logic to correctly produce the report once developer knew location of input data.

Client was not interested on 'good looking' report for public view, but in raw results to support executive decisions.

I ended up creating the report myself in BASE SAS programming in less than 3 hours -- delivered at 11:59 pm, midnight was the deadline.
